        <p>Coming straight at you was Scream! You pressed the button and that did...   ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! You both scream as Scream came at you only to surprise you both by revealing that he was a normal guy. You both look around to see that there were other people who had set this up as a little scare. Once you both calmed down and laughed with them, you both enjoyed the rest of your night making new friends.</p>
